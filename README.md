### Goal

🚀 The goal of building BotMate is to make it easier for developers to manage and deploy multiple chat bots. We understand that managing multiple bots can be a daunting task, requiring switching between multiple projects and setting up separate databases. In fact, it's not uncommon to end up writing duplicate code for multiple bots, leading to increased development time and effort.

That's where BotMate comes in. With our flexible plugin system and centralized dashboard, you can easily manage all your bots in one place. No more switching between multiple projects or setting up separate databases. Plus, BotMate provides inbuilt functions like accessing databases and common utility functions to speed up the development process.

🤖 Our mission is to streamline bot development and make it accessible to developers of all skill levels. Try BotMate today and see how we can simplify your bot development workflow!
